I am the leader of these dotfiles. Unfortunately, due to an upgrade to Windows 8.1, my old VM was rendered incapable of connecting to the internet for some bizzare reason. After about an hour and a half of attempting to fix it, I gave up and decided to just create a new VM. As a result, I do not have my old aliases or my old bashrc config. :(
